Title "Right inverse"

Introduction "
We've seen that $a^{-1} * a = 1$. In this level, you'll prove that $a * a^{-1} = 1$.

Below is a template proof. Replace the `sorry` in the editor pane with this template.
To complete the proof, fill in the `sorry` placeholders.

```
calc
  a * a⁻¹ = sorry   := by sorry
  _ = 1         := by sorry
```

`mul_right_inv (a : G)` is the proof that `a * a⁻¹ = 1`.

This is right inverse property
