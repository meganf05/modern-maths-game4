Level 1
Title "Uniqueness of identity"

Introduction "
We'll show that the identity is unique. That is, we'll prove:

**Theorem** Suppose $b$ is an element of $G$ such that $b * a = a$,
for every $a$ in $G$. Then $b = 1$.

We'll use the following 'traditional' mathematics proof as a template.

**Proof**
$$
\\begin{align*}
b & = b * 1 && [\\text{by identity property}] \\\\
  & = 1.     && [\\text{by the hypothesis}]
\\end{align*}
$$

You'll work on the entire proof file in this level, rather than writing a proof
a line-at-a-time. In the pane on the right, replace each `sorry` with an appropriate
rewrite.

*Note* to rewrite with the hypothesis `h`, use `rw [h]`.

`eq_one_of_self_mul_eq (b : G) h` is the proof of `b = 1` if `h` is the hypothesis
`h :  ∀ (a : G), b * a = a`.

This is uniqueness of (left) identity in a group.
