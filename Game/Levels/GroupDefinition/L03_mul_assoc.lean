Title "Multiplicative associativity"

Introduction "
Brackets can be shifted in a group. This property is called associativity. In Lean, `mul_assoc`
is the theorem that $(a*b)*c = a*(b*c)$.
"

/-- `mul_assoc` is a proof that `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`

Note that Lean will write `(a * b) * c` as `a * b * c` to minimise the use of brackets.
