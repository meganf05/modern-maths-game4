Title "Modern Mathematics Game"
Introduction
"
This is an interactive book aimed at beginning mathematics undergraduates. You'll learn to prove
theorems online using a computer tool called Lean.

Each chapter is represented by a coloured circular button in the right-hand pane. Blue indicates your
current position, green is for completed chapters, and grey is for unread or incomplete chapters.

At every stage in a proof, there is a *target*, the thing you want to prove, and a *context*, the
set of things you have already proved or assumed at the beginning of your argument.
The target and context change through the proof.

The word *goal* is used to refer variously to the target or to the combination of target and context.

You'll use *tactics* to modify the goal until you have proved the target (called 'closing the goal').
Each tactic may invoke one or more *theorems*.
